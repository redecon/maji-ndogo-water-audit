#  Water Accessibility and Infrastructure Summary Report – Maji Ndogo

---

##  Survey Objectives

This survey aimed to:
- Identify the types of water sources used by citizens
- Measure total and average population served per source
- Analyze queue durations and patterns to inform infrastructure planning

---

##  Key Insights

1. **Rural Dominance**: Most water sources are located in rural areas, posing logistical challenges for upgrades.
2. **Shared Taps**: 43% of citizens rely on shared taps, with ~2000 people per tap — the most strained source.
3. **Home Infrastructure**: 31% have taps at home, but 45% of these systems are non-functional due to upstream infrastructure failures.
4. **Wells**: 18% use wells, but only 28% are clean — contamination is a major concern.
5. **Queue Times**: Average wait time exceeds 120 minutes, far above the UN’s recommended 30-minute threshold.
6. **Queue Patterns**:
   - **Longest**: Saturdays and weekday mornings/evenings
   - **Shortest**: Sundays (due to cultural priorities) and midweek afternoons

##  Strategic Plan

1. **Prioritize High-Impact Repairs**:
   - Focus on shared taps first — they serve the most people and have the longest queues.
   - Repair broken infrastructure (pipes, reservoirs) to restore home access and reduce public queue pressure.
   - Improve well quality with filtration systems (UV for biological, reverse osmosis for chemical).
2. **Rural Deployment Strategy**:
   - Equip teams for rural terrain and supply challenges.
   - Use location data to optimize dispatch routes and resource allocation.

##  Practical Solutions

1. **River Users**: Send water trucks short-term; drill wells long-term.
2. **Well Users**: Install filters now; investigate pollution sources for sustainable fixes.
3. **Shared Taps**:
   - Send tankers during peak hours (based on queue pivot table)
   - Install additional taps to reduce load
   - Aim to bring queue times below 30 minutes
4. **Low-Queue Shared Taps**: Consider home tap installation as a long-term goal.
5. **Infrastructure Repairs**: Target high-impact fixes — one reservoir or pipe can restore access for thousands.

##  Next Steps

- Await cost estimates for repairs and upgrades
- Use queue time pivot table to guide tanker dispatch and tap installations
- Begin mapping contamination sources and infrastructure dependencies
